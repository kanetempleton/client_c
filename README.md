# client_c
multiplayer game client written in C using SDL2



to run:

open terminal/command prompt

0. run the server first (see readme file in the server folder)
1. cd to this directory (ex: "cd user/desktop/client")
2. type "./compile.sh" (or copy and paste the entire file into the terminal window)
3. type "./main" to run the server

* server must be online before the client can run, so run this program first!
* note that if using a windows computer, you may need to change all forward slashes '/' to back slashes '\' in compile.sh

** YOU MAY NEED THE SDL2 LIBRARY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPILE THIS
- try skipping step 2 if you are on a mac and see if the already-compiled output files will run fine
- if this doesn't work and you're determined to run it, google how to intsall SDL2
